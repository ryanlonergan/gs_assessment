Assumptions
- Snapshot_1 is cleaner than Snapshot_2 and should be used as the greater source of truth between the two snapshots.
- The snapshot columns represent the same data, but the columns were named differently between exports.
- SKU's that don't follow the same format ('SKU-###') are from unclean data entry and do not represent new items.
